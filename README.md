## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

I'm aiming for a super simple yet fun website where you can get to know me professionally and maybe share a laugh or two. So, I thought, why not create a quirky CLI-style website? It's a little project that's all about having some fun while learning about me.

It's built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ nothing too fancy, I'm afraid. But hey, simplicity can be pretty cool too, right?
